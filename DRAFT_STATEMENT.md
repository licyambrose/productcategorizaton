I lead initiatives related to Social commerce in my current. One of the main products we have now is posting seller product images and videos in social provider sites. Some product images may contain inappropriate content which could damage company's brand which posting such images in Social media. So I am picking up project with the ML we are able to scan image to detect product category and also perform safety assessment on inappropriate content  in the images.

A general overview of the question you will be asking/solving for
How can automated image recognition systems be developed to accurately classify visual content and assess its appropriateness, ensuring efficient categorization and content safety across diverse applications?

The data you think you’ll need to answer this question
Compile a diverse dataset of images representing various categories and include samples of potentially inappropriate or sensitive content for training.
Label each image with both a category and a safety flag indicating its appropriateness.
We have not gone through classification model in our weekly modules. I googled for Convolution Neural Network for images. It might be suitable to apply this for the project work
Since images are unstructured data based on the online classes from module 6 we need to explore Keras and pytorch
List 1–3 techniques you might use to answer this question based on what you’ve learned so far
we have not explored image scan in our sessions I googled about Convolution Neural Network for images which I heard from Module 6 live classs

Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs):

Overview: CNNs are a class of deep neural networks that are particularly effective for image processing tasks. They use convolutional layers to automatically learn spatial hierarchies of features from input images.
Application: CNNs can be used to build models that classify images into predefined categories and detect inappropriate content based on learned features. They are adept at handling the complexities and variations present in visual data.
Benefits: CNNs are highly effective at capturing local and global patterns in images, making them suitable for both classification and safety assessment tasks.
Multitasking capabilities
Overview: Multi-task learning involves training a single model to perform multiple tasks simultaneously, such as image classification and safety assessment. This approach shares representations across tasks, improving efficiency and performance.
Application: By designing a model that jointly optimizes for both classification and safety detection, multi-task learning can enhance the system's ability to understand and categorize complex visual data.
Benefits: Multi-task learning can lead to better generalization and performance across tasks, as the model learns shared features that are beneficial for multiple objectives.
